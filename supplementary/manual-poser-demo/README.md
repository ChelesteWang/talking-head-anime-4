To run this demo, please start a web browser in **this** directory. An easy way to do this is to use a web server that comes with the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language:

```
cd manual-poser-demo
python -m http.server
```

Once the web server is up and running, access what URL that it tells you where served web site is available. This is typically http://localhost:8000.
